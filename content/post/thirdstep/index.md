### ***History***


    - LaTeX (whose logo is LATEX) is a language and system for composing documents. This is a collection of macro commands intended to facilitate the use of Donald Knuth's TeX "text processor".

    - LaTeX makes it possible to write documents whose layout is carried out automatically by conforming as best as possible to typographic standards. A distinctive feature of LaTeX is its mathematical mode, which allows you to compose complex formulas.

    - LaTeX is particularly used in technical and scientific fields for the production of medium-sized documents (such as articles) or large (theses or books, for example). Nevertheless, it can be used to generate documents of a wide variety of types (letters or transparencies, for example). Finally, many websites - whose text is typically formatted by other means - use a subset of LaTeX to compose their mathematical formulas, in particular.

    - It was developed by Leslie Lamport in the early 1980s3. Since 1989, it has been maintained by a team of volunteers within the LaTeX3 project.

### ***Operation***

    - LaTeX comes in the form of a markup computer language. So we compose a LaTeX document by writing its source code using a text editor. This source code is then processed by the LaTeX compiler to produce the formatted document. The result is provided in a TeX-specific page description format, the DVI format (Device Independent, meaning "device independent"). This format can then be printed, or translated into one of the PostScript or PDF formats.

    - Many lightweight markup languages (such as txt2tags, reST or POD) can be exported to the LaTeX language. It is thus possible to write your documents in one of these languages, simpler and more readable than LaTeX, for the same final rendering. On the other hand, the possibilities of shaping are generally severely restricted.

    - LaTeX realizes the principle of separation of bottom and shape. It encourages the writer to focus on the logical structure and content of his document, while its layout (pagination, hyphenation of words, paragraphs, insertion of headers and footers ...) is left to the compiler.
### ***Quality***


    - LaTeX requires more initial learning than is necessary for WYSIWYG-like software, at least for the layout of small, simple documents. On the other hand, the system makes it possible to compose a very wide variety of mathematical formulas, the document produced has a high typographic quality, bibliographic references are easy to insert and group (thanks to BibTeX), titles are numbered and tables of contents generated automatically.
